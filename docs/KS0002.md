![](./media/A1.png)

## Introduction:

Keyestudio Mega 2560 R3 is a microcontroller board based on the ATMEGA2560-16AU , fully compatible with ARDUINO MEGA 2560 REV3.
It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 15 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, 2 ICSP headers, and a reset button.
It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller. With its bootloader, program can be downloaded directly with USB and you don’t need to use other external programmer.
Just simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.
The Mega 2560 board is compatible with most shields designed for the Uno.
The 2560 R3 differs from all preceding boards in that it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip. Instead, it features the Atmega16U2 programmed as a USB-to-serial converter.
The MEGA 2560 is designed for more complex projects. With 54 digital I/O pins, 16 analog inputs and a larger space for your sketch, it is the recommended board for 3D printers and robotics projects. This gives your projects plenty of room and opportunities.

## Design of Power Supply

There are two choices (direct power supply trough USB or external power supply) for the power supply system of Arduino Mega, and they can be automatically switched. External power supply can be AC-to-DC adapter or battery. Voltage input of this control board is 6V~12V, but if the supplied voltage is greater than 12V, the voltage stabilizing device will be likely to be overheated to damage Arduino MEGA. So we suggest the power supply should be 6.5~12V in operation and recommended supply is 7.5 or 9V.

| ![](./media/A4.png)                  | **Digital I/O**Arduino MEGA has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 15 can be used as PWM outputs). These pins can be configured as digital input pin to read the logic value (0 or 1). Or used as digital output pin to drive different modules like LED, relay, etc. Using [pinMode()](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/pinmode/), [digitalWrite()](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/digitalwrite/), and [digitalRead()](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/digitalread/) functions. |

## Specialized Functions of Some Pins

- **Serial Communication:** D0 (RX0) and D1 (TX1); Serial 1: D19 (RX1) and D18 (TX1); Serial 2: D17 (RX2) and D16 (TX2); Serial 3: D15 (RX3) and D14 (TX3).

Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data. Pins 0 and 1 are also connected to the corresponding pins of the ATmega16U2 USB-to-TTL Serial chip.

- **PWM Pins (Pulse-Width Modulation):** D2 to D13, and D44 to D46.

Provide 8-bit PWM output with the [analogWrite()](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/analog-io/analogwrite/) function.

- **External Interrupts:** D2 (interrupt 0), D3 (interrupt 1), D18 (interrupt 5), D19 (interrupt 4), D20 (interrupt 3), and D21 (interrupt 2).

These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low level, a rising or falling edge, or a change in level. See the [attachInterrupt()](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/external-interrupts/attachinterrupt/) function for details.

- **SPI communication:** D53 (SS), D52 (SCK), D51 (MOSI), D50 (MISO).

These pins support SPI communication using theSPI library. The SPI pins are also broken out on the ICSP header, which is physically compatible with the Arduino Uno.

- **IIC communication:** D20 (SDA); D21 (SCL). Support TWI communication using the [Wire library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire).

## Warnings

**1.** The Mega 2560 has a resettable polyfuse that protects your computer's USB ports from shorts and overcurrent. If more than 500 mA is applied to the USB port, the fuse will automatically break the connection until the short or overload is removed.
**2.** Automatic (Software) Reset:
Rather than requiring a physical press of the reset button before an upload, the Mega 2560 board is designed in a way that allows it to be reset by software running on a connected computer.
**3.** The Mega 2560 board contains a trace that can be cut to disable the auto-reset. The pads on either side of the trace can be soldered together to re-enable it. It's labeled "RESET-EN". You may also be able to disable the auto-reset by connecting a 110 ohm resistor from 5V to the reset line; see [this forum thread](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php/topic,22974.0.html) for details.
